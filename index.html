                    <p>A mix of mint, green tea leaves, and a generous serving of sugar,
                        Touareg tea (also known as Maghrebi mint tea) is the customary blend in this North African
                        country.
                        Poured from up high into slim, delicate glasses, it's served three times to guests.
                        Each time the flavor varies slightly. Per the proverb: <strong>"The first glass is as gentle as
                            life,
                            the second is as strong as love, the third is as bitter as death."</strong>
                        Refusing any one of these servings is considered the height of rudeness.</p>

                    <p>Forget the “milk or lemon” debate. How about adding some salty butter to your tea? Po cha,
                        the traditional tea of Tibet, is made by boiling a brick of Pemagul black tea for hours.
                        From there, milk, salt, and yak butter are added, and the mixture is then churned together.
                        It's said this blend with a soup-like consistency is uniquely comforting and fortifying in the
                        high-altitude and cold climates.

                        sniff—not drink—the very strong and bitter brew.

                        An element of Kashmiri culture, Noon Chai is a special blend of tea that includes a
                        mix of pistachios, almonds, salt, milk, and spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and star anise.
                        It's easy to pick out because of its signature pink color, which can be enhanced with a bit
                        of baking soda. Served on special occasions, Noon Chai is typically enjoyed with pastries
                        like sheermaal, kandir tchot, bakarkhani, and kulcha. More casually enjoyed is "Doodh Pati,"
                        or milk tea, which involves no water.

        <p>According to legend, tea was first discovered by the legendary Chinese emperor and herbalist, Shennong, in
            2737 BCE.[3] It is said that the emperor liked his drinking water boiled before he drank it so it would be
            clean, so that is what his servants did. One day, on a trip to a distant region, he and his army stopped to
            rest. A servant began boiling water for him to drink, and a dead leaf from the wild tea bush fell into the
            water. It turned a brownish color, but it was unnoticed and presented to the emperor anyway. The emperor
            drank it and found it very refreshing, and cha (tea) came into being.[citation needed]

            Lu Yu's statue in Xi'an.
            The Erya, a Chinese dictionary dated to the 3rd century BCE, records that an infusion of some kind of leaf
            was used as early as the Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 BCE).[4]
        </p>

            In 1753, Linnaeus described the plant as a single species, Thea sinensis. Later, however, he recognized two
            species, Thea Bohea and Thea viridis, as cultivated in China, and it was long thought that these were the
            origin of black and green tea respectively.
